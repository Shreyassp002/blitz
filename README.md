A decentralized auction platform where users bid on QR codes to control their destination links for 24-hour periods. The same QR code remains constant while the underlying link changes based on auction winners, making it perfect for traffic generation, promotion, and marketing campaigns.

## Project Overview

Blitz enables a continuous auction system where:
- QR codes are auctioned in 24-hour cycles
- Winners control the QR code's destination for the next 24 hours
- Auctions run continuously, creating a perpetual bidding ecosystem
- Perfect for businesses seeking traffic, promotion, and marketing exposure

## Architecture

- **Smart Contracts**: Built on Soroban smart contract platform running on the Stellar network
- **Frontend**: Next.js application with modern UI for auction participation
- **QR Code Management**: Dynamic link updates while maintaining consistent QR code appearance

## Key Features

- 24-hour auction cycles
- Real-time bidding interface
- Dynamic QR code destination management
- Decentralized auction settlement
- Continuous auction system
